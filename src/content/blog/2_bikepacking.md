# Autumn Bikepacking

Zipping along the Potomac river, past the multi-colored foliage, waking up to a brisk morning with a cup of coffee. This was the most that I've appreciated the Autumn in years.

I completed my first bikepacking adventure with a friend after talking about doing one for literal years. I wanna talk a little about my experience.

### The S24O

The trip was a sub-24-hour overnight ([S24O](https://www.adventurecycling.org/blog/s24os/))—a term coined by Grant Petersen—up the C&O canal towpath. An S24O is minimal bikepacking trip that you can complete in a 24-hour window. The idea is that you can find the time to escape, you can leave one day after work and be back in time for breakfast. Bikepacking doesn't have to be a grand, multi-day adventure. The S24O is a way to accomplish that.

I always talked myself out of a trip. Saying things like: I don't have the right gear, I'm not fit enough, I don't have enough time, etc. You'll find that you can always come up with an excuse. You might not have enough gear, but oh well—you're uncomfortable for a night. You might not think you're fit enough—you don't have to go that far to be away from the city lights. You might think you don't have enough time, but again you can leave after work and be back in time for breakfast. Get out there and adventuring.

I very much romanticized the idea of bikepacking in my mind, yet never made the time for it until now and it definitely lived up to my expectations. It was the perfect ode to Autumn. The foliage in the DMV area is really something special. It's amazing how accessible nature is in the Washington metro area. In fact, I enjoyed the route so much that I went back the next weekend for a hike.

My hobbies often include things on opposite sides of the spectrum: indoor, less-social things like reading and video games and then things like camping and hiking and backpacking outside. I often opt for the safer, indoor options, but I am literally never dissatisfied when I pick the adventure.

### The Gear & The Steed

I deliberately didn't buy any extra racks/bags. Partly from a frugality perspective and partly from a _"let's see what I really need"_ perspective. I brought nothing that I regret, but there was plenty that I wish I had. All of it comes down to creature comforts. These are the things that I would take the next time I do this, if/when I had the space:

- **camping chair** - it's nice not to have to sit on the ground when you're cooking or hangning out drinking _camping juice_ as a friend likes to say 

- **under quilt or sleeping pad** - it got a little cold in the hammock at night—even at 50+ degrees. I'm never gonna be too proud to say that I was chilly

- **my [Snow Peak Collapsible Coffee Drip](https://www.snowpeak.com/products/collapsible_pour_over-cs-113) pour over** - instant coffee did the trick and I honestly forgot I owned this. I really enjoy the ceremony of brewing coffee, especially outside

- **some way to filter non-potable water** - WATER IS IMPORTANT! We ended up using a lot for cooking (and someone only brought one bottle, but I'm not pointing fingers)

- **more snacks** - duh, we kinda bonked in the morning on the way back

The bike handled the minimalist setup really well. As a rando bike, the Crust Lightning Bolt (pictured above) is really only designed for shorter 1-2 day trips like this. Wrapped in 42mm tires, the Bolt was nimble, comfortable, and speedy. I didn't mind that the bike weighed about 50lbs fully-laden. Dynamo lighting seems like a must-have on trips like this. It's just too convenient not to have.

### The Takeaway

If you think that bikepacking is something that you'd like to try, then you should do it. I had a blast and learned a lot that will inform my trips going forward. This S24O model is approachable. It leaves little room to make excuses for yourself. Get out there, enjoy nature, especially the fall season.
