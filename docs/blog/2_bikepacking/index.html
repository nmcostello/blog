<p>Zipping along the Potomac river, past the multi-colored foliage, waking up to a brisk morning with a cup of coffee. This was the most that I’ve appreciated the Autumn in years.</p>
<p>I completed my first bikepacking adventure with a friend after talking about doing one for years. It was a sub-24-hour overnight (<a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/blog/s24os/">S24O</a>)—barely—up the C&#x26;O canal towpath. An S24O is minimal bikepacking trip that you can complete in a 24-hour window. The idea is that you can find the time to escape, you can leave one day after work and be back in time for breakfast. Bikepacking doesn’t have to be a grand, multi-day adventure. The S24O is a way to accomplish that.</p>
<p>I very much romanticized the idea of bikepacking in my mind, yet never made the time for it until now and it definitely lived up to my expectations. It was the perfect ode to Autumn. The foliage in the DMV area is really something special. It’s amazing how accessible nature is in the Washington metro area. In fact, I enjoyed the route so much that I went back the next weekend for a hike.</p>
<p>I deliberately didn’t buy any extra racks/bags. Partly from a frugality perspective and partly from a “let’s see what I really need” perspective. I brought nothing that I regret, but there was plenty that I wish I had. All of it comes down to creature comforts. These are the things that I would take the next time I do this, if/when I had the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>camping chair - it’s nice not to have to sit on the ground</li>
<li>under quilt or sleeping pad - it got a little cold in the hammock at night - even at 50+ degrees</li>
<li>my <a href="https://www.snowpeak.com/products/collapsible_pour_over-cs-113">Snow Peak Collapsible Coffee Drip</a> pour over - although instant coffee did the trick, this is a bit more romantic</li>
<li>some way to filter non-potable water - we ended up using a lot for cooking (and someone only brought one bottle, but I’m not pointing fingers)</li>
<li>more snacks - duh</li>
</ul>
<p>The bike handled the minimalist setup really well. As a rando bike, the Crust Lightning Bolt (above) is really only designed for shorter 1-2 day trips like this. Wrapped in 42mm tires, the Bolt was nimble, comfortable, and speedy. I didn’t mind that the bike weighed about 50lbs fully-laden. Dynamo lighting seems like a must-have on trips like this. It’s just too convenient not to have.</p>
<p>I’m worried that it’s getting a little too cold to go again this fall, but I’m still holding out for another trip.</p>   </body></html>
