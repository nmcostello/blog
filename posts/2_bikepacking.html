<h1>Autumn Bikepacking</h1>

<p>I went on my first bikepacking trip with a friend after talking about doing one for years. It was a sub-24-hour overnight (<a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/blog/s24os/">S24O</a>)—barely—up the C&O canal towpath.</p>

<p>The adventure was successful and it was everything that I hoped for.</p>
<p>This was the perfect ode to Autumn. The foliage in the DMV area is really something special. It's amazing how accessible nature is in the Washington metro area. In fact, I enjoyed the route so much that I went back the next weekend for a hike.</p>

<p>I chose not to purchase any additional racks or bags, which resulted in a lean packing list. I brought nothing that I regret, but there was plenty that I wish I had. All of it comes down to creature comforts.</p>

<p>I would definitely get some additional cargo space for future trips. These are the items I wished I had:</p>

<ul>
	<li>camping chair - it's nice not to have to sit on the ground</li>
	<li>under quilt or sleeping pad - it got a little cold in the hammock at night - even at 50+ degrees</li>
	<li>my <a href="https://www.snowpeak.com/products/collapsible_pour_over-cs-113">Snow Peak Collapsible Coffee Drip</a>
		pour over - instant coffee did the trick</li>
	<li>some way to filter non-potable water - we ended up using a lot for cooking (and someone only brought one bottle, but I'm not pointing fingers)</li>
	<li>more snacks - duh</li>
</ul>

<p>The Crust Lightning Bolt (pictured above), wrapped in 42mm tires, was nimble, comfortable, and speedy. I didn't really mind that the bike weighed about 50lbs fully-laden. Dynamo lighting seems like a must-have on trips like this. It's just too convenient not to have.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that, as a rando bike, the Lightning Bolt is really only capable designed for shorter 1-2 day trips like this</p>

<p>I'm worried that it's getting a little too cold to go again this fall, but I'm still holding out for another trip.</p>
