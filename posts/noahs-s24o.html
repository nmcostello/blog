<h1>Autumn Bikepacking</h1>

<img src="../pictures/crust.jpeg">

<p>I went on my first bikepacking trip with a friend. It was a sub-24-hour overnight (<a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/blog/s24os/">S24O</a>) but just barely.</p>

<p>The adventure was successful and it was everything that I hoped for. It was the perfect ode to Autumn. The foliage in the DMV area is really something special. It's amazing how accessible nature is in the Washington metro area. In fact, I enjoyed the route so much that I went back the next weekend for a hike.</p>

<p>I kept the purchasing of additional bags and racks to a minimum, which resulted in a lean packing list. I brought nothing that I regret, but there was plenty that I wish I had. All of it comes down to creature comforts.</p>

<p>For future trips, I would definitely get some additional cargo space. These are the items I wished I had:</p>

<ul>
  <li>camping chair - it's nice not to have to sit on the ground</li>
  <li>under quilt or sleeping pad - it got a little cold in the hammock at night</li>
  <li>my <a href="https://www.snowpeak.com/products/collapsible_pour_over-cs-113">Snow Peak Collapsible Coffee Drip</a> pour over - instant coffee did the trick</li>
  <li>some way to filter non-potable water</li>
  <li>more snacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The Crust Lightning Bolt (pictured above), wrapped in 42mm tires, was nimble and comfortable. The bike itself weighed about 50lbs fully-laden but I didn't notice. Dynamo lighting seems like a must-have on trips like this. It's just too convenient not to have.</p>

<p>I'm worried that it's getting a little too cold to go again this fall, but I'm still holding out for another trip.</p>
